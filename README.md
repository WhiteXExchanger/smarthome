Python Smarthome

This project is based on Raspberry Pi and Python, done by Me and two fellow stundets to showcase what can be done in some fun school projects.

Our project focuses on a all in one controlling/monitoring device for a smart home.
This covers controlling lights, monitoring windows states (closed/open) and remotely controlling a garage door.
